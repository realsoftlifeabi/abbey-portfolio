overview: >
  Design Synchrony needed a single website that could clearly present two very different services — physical printing and digital web development — without confusing visitors.  
  The challenge was to help users quickly understand what the company offers, find the right service, and make contact with minimal friction.  
  We solved this by designing a vibrant, well-structured website with clear service separation, strong calls to action, and a responsive layout tailored for both desktop and mobile users.
