overview: >
  Rhenda is a service marketplace that helps users find and connect with professional service providers (Rhendors) — from barbers and tailors to developers and plumbers — all in one place. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
  The challenge was to build a frontend that makes browsing services, discovering professionals, and navigating between community interactions intuitive and fast.  
  I developed the dashboard using React.js, emphasizing clarity, responsiveness, and seamless interaction with backend APIs for listings, search, and user flows.

features:
  - icon: '🔎'
    title: 'Service Discovery'
    description: 'Allows users to browse or search for available service providers (Rhendors) by category.'

  - icon: '👤'
    title: 'Provider Profiles'
    description: 'Displays details, descriptions, and contact points for each listed professional.'

  - icon: '🗺️'
    title: 'Location & Filtering'
    description: 'Supports filtering and locating service providers based on region and user preferences.'

  - icon: '💬'
    title: 'Interaction Flow'
    description: 'User flows designed for signing up, logging in, and engaging with provider listings and details.'

  - icon: '📱'
    title: 'Responsive Experience'
    description: 'Responsive layout optimized for desktop and mobile devices using React.js and Tailwind CSS.'

technologies:
  frontend: ['React.js', 'Tailwind CSS']
  data: ['Axios', 'REST APIs']
  ux: ['Responsive Design', 'User Flow Optimization']
  deploy: ['Vercel']

outcome: >
  Rhenda needed a clear and responsive way for users to find and connect with local professionals, so I built the React.js frontend to help users explore services, view provider details, and navigate the marketplace easily.
