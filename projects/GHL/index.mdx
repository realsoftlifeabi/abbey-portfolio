overview: >
  Tracking performance across multiple analytics platforms made it difficult for teams to get a clear view of what was working.  
  The Integration Dashboard was built to bring Google and GoHighLevel (GHL) data into one centralized interface, removing the need to switch between tools.  
  The focus was on clarity, speed, and usability—so key metrics and trends could be understood at a glance.
