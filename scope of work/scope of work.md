# LiftOff Portfolio Rebrand — Actionable Scope of Work

## Executive Summary

LiftOff is Abiodun Sanni’s high-speed launch system for startups and SaaS founders, combining strategic UX, motion-rich visuals, and production-grade Next.js builds. This plan outlines a 30-day revamp of `sanniabiodun.name.ng`, transforming it into the definitive LiftOff showcase, stacked with proof, clarity, and conversion-focused storytelling.

## Objective

Position Abiodun Sanni (operating as LiftOff) as the go-to landing page designer for startups and SaaS founders by rebuilding `sanniabiodun.name.ng` with a conversion-first narrative where the LiftOff identity amplifies Abiodun’s personal credibility.

## Success Metrics

- Increase inbound demo/audit requests by **3×** within 60 days of launch.
- Showcase a minimum of **3 detailed case studies** drawn from proven work (`FI Options`, `Fin-Sync`, `Portal Apply`).
- Achieve **desktop/mobile Lighthouse scores ≥ 90** for performance and accessibility.
- Grow newsletter or waitlist signups to **100+** in the first quarter post-launch.
- Earn recognition as a **top SaaS landing page designer on LinkedIn** within 3 months (qualitative: increased tags, mentions, and inbound DMs).

## Phase 1 — Strategic Foundation (Days 1–3)

- **Clarify audience positioning**: Document the ideal founder profile (SaaS, AI, fintech) and their buying triggers. Map pain points and desired outcomes in a one-page brief.
- **Define services & offers**: Productize the “7-day LiftOff Launch” with scope, pricing, inclusions, and FAQs. Align upsell pathways (e.g., ongoing CRO retainers).
- **Audit current touchpoints**: Review existing portfolio, LinkedIn, and Dribbble/Behance to identify gaps in messaging, visuals, and proof. Note reusable assets.
- **Competitive teardown**: Collect 5 standout landing page specialists for reference. Extract differentiators you can amplify (speed, strategy, dev depth).

### Audience Positioning Brief

- **Primary ICP**: Pre-seed to Series A SaaS founders and growth leaders in fintech, AI automation, and B2B productivity niches who need a conversion-focused launch or relaunch within 2 weeks.
- **Pain Points**: Lack of in-house design/dev, slow agency timelines, unclear messaging, poor conversion analytics, difficulty showcasing product credibility pre-launch.
- **Desired Outcomes**: Ship a high-converting landing page, validate positioning fast, gather investor/client interest, and show traction through polished UX narratives.
- **Buying Triggers**: Product pivots, funding announcements, beta waitlists, accelerator milestones, and upcoming product hunts or conference demos.
- **Brand Promise**: “LiftOff gets your startup launch-ready in 7 days with strategy-backed design and production-grade Next.js execution.”

> Future task: break each checklist item into actionable subtasks in Notion. Example for “Audit current touchpoints”: `Portfolio site`, `LinkedIn`, `Dribbble`, `Behance`, `GitHub`, `Email sequence`.

### Services & Offers

- **Core Offer — LiftOff Launch Sprint (₦750k / $1.2k)**
  - Deliverables: Discovery workshop, messaging refinement, hero + 4 supporting sections, responsive Next.js build, light/dark theme, analytics + SEO setup.
  - Timeline: 7 days (2 discovery, 3 design, 2 build/QA).
  - Bonus: 30-day post-launch support checklist and Loom handoff.
- **Add-on — Conversion Optimization Retainer (₦250k / $400 per month)**

### Touchpoint Audit Summary

- **Current Portfolio (`sanniabiodun.name.ng`)**: Strong breadth of work but lacks narrative hierarchy, consistent CTA, and distinct LiftOff branding. Screenshots exist but need updated copy and motion cues.
- **LinkedIn**: Active posts on design/dev; opportunity to pin LiftOff positioning statement and link to updated case studies.
- **Dribbble/Behance**: Pieces are scattered; curate a LiftOff collection featuring `Fin-Sync`, `Integration Dashboard`, and `Awozwa` for visual consistency.
- **GitHub/Notion Assets**: `/projects/` directory already houses screenshots; consolidate into a shared Notion board for tracking asset status and testimonial outreach.

### Competitive Teardown (Snapshot)

- **Flowbase Studio** — Rapid Framer builds; highlight LiftOff’s hybrid design/dev depth and Next.js scalability.
- **Lemon Squeezy Design** — Strong copy-led SaaS launches; counter with LiftOff’s 7-day sprint and analytics integration.
- **Pangram Labs** — High-end motion design; differentiate with pragmatic pricing and developer-ready deliverables.
- **Unicorn Factory Designers** — Template-heavy; emphasize LiftOff’s bespoke, research-driven approach.
- **Superside Landing Teams** — Enterprise scale; position LiftOff as nimble, founder-collaborative, and outcome-focused.

## Phase 2 — Asset & Content Production (Days 3–7)

- **Curate hero project roster**: Select 3–4 anchor projects spanning fintech (`FI Options`, `Fin-Sync`), SaaS (`Portal Apply`, `Integration Dashboard`), and branded experiences (`Bouwbedrijf Lookman`). Capture URLs, screen recordings, and testimonials.
- **Draft case study outlines**:
  - `FI Options`: highlight multilingual Next.js execution and conversion lift from localized messaging.
  - `Fin-Sync`: emphasize AI assistant UX, Tailwind UI system, and financial clarity outcomes.
  - `Portal Apply`: focus on multi-role flows, partnership monetization, and speed-to-launch.
- **Gather supporting visuals**: Export high-fidelity screens from `past projects.txt` sources, capture Lottie-ready animations, and collect brand palettes.
- **Collect social proof**: Reach out to `Design Synchrony`, `Tera Organics`, and `Bouwbedrijf Lookman` stakeholders for short quotes; craft narrative testimonials if data is unavailable.
- **Design SEO/content outline**: Write page-by-page copy structure: hero, offer stack, process, testimonials, CTA, FAQ, contact. Include keyword targets (e.g., “landing page designer for SaaS”).

- Hero project roster selection — **2 hrs**
- Case study outline writing — **6 hrs**
- Asset gathering & clean-up — **6 hrs**
- Social proof outreach & copy — **4 hrs**

### Visual Asset Inventory Plan

- **Screenshot Capture**: Use existing assets under `/projects/` and supplement with updated hero/mockup renders for `FI-Options`, `Fin-sync`, `Portal-apply`, `GHL`, and `Lookman`.
- **Motion Assets**: Identify sections suited for Lottie animations (hero, testimonials). Create JSON exports stored in `/public/lottie/` for local hosting.
- **Video Walkthroughs**: Record 60–90s Loom clips demonstrating key flows; store links in Notion asset tracker and embed previews in case studies.
- **Brand Palette Library**: Extract HEX codes per project, ensure they feed into Tailwind config for theme toggles.

### Social Proof Plan

- **Testimonial Outreach**: Draft personalized requests for `Design Synchrony`, `Tera Organics`, and `Bouwbedrijf Lookman` clients focusing on business outcomes.

### SEO & Content Outline

- **Hero**: Keyword — “landing page designer for SaaS startups”; CTA “Book a LiftOff Audit”.

- **Case Studies**: Dedicated cards linking to `/projects/[slug]` MDX pages with schema markup for “CreativeWork”.
- **Testimonials**: Rotating carousel with client roles, outcomes, and sector tags.
- **CTA Footer**: Dual-option (Audit booking, Email outreach) with calendar embed and compliance copy.

## Phase 3 — Visual Identity & UX Design (Days 7–12)

- **Moodboard & style tiles**: Build light/dark theme explorations using LiftOff palette (electric blue/orange accents). Include motion references using Lottie & Framer Motion.
- **Component library in Figma**: Define typography scale (Inter/Poppins), buttons, cards, testimonial blocks, and pricing sections. Ensure responsive states.
- **Prototype hero and project sections**: Validate hierarchy, CTA prominence, and narrative flow with 2–3 stakeholder review cycles.
- **Plan micro-interactions**: Document animation specs for hero reveal, project hover states, and CTA emphasis using Framer Motion timelines.

## Phase 4 — Development & Integration (Days 12–20)

- **Set up Next.js 14 project**: Configure `/app` router, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, `next-seo`, and theming system (light/dark toggle).
- **Build modular components**: Implement `Hero`, `ProjectShowcase`, `CaseStudyHighlights`, `ProcessTimeline`, `TestimonialCarousel`, `CTASection`, and `ContactForm` with reusable props.
- **Integrate content layer**: Use MDX or CMS (e.g., Contentlayer/Sanity) to manage case study content, ensuring scalability for future additions.
- **Implement animations**: Apply Framer Motion for section entrances and hover states. Embed local Lottie files for hero visuals.
- **Planned integrations**: Contentlayer (core), GA4 analytics (core), PostHog session insights (optional), Formspree/Resend for contact automation (core), Notion API for testimonial updates (optional).
- **Optimize assets**: Compress imagery, generate WebP, and preload critical fonts. Ensure responsive breakpoints across devices.

## Phase 5 — Measurement & Launch (Days 20–25)

- **QA & accessibility pass**: Run automated tests (Lighthouse, Axe) and manual keyboard navigation audits. Fix contrast or semantic issues.
- **SEO & analytics setup**: Configure `next-seo` metadata, Open Graph imagery, sitemap, robots, and tie in Google Analytics 4 + privacy notice.
- **Form & automation hooks**: Connect `Resend`/`Formspree` or custom API for contact form, pipe submissions into CRM or Notion database.
- **Launch plan**: Prepare announcement assets for LinkedIn, X, newsletter, and designer communities. Sequence teasers, launch thread, and portfolio walkthrough.
- **Post-launch optimization**: Set cadence for weekly analytics review, A/B testing of CTA copy, and case study rotations based on traction.
- **Soft launch**: Share the updated site with trusted peers and beta founders for feedback on copy, motion, and conversion flow before public announcement.

## Phase 6 — Evergreen Growth (Post-launch)

- **Content calendar**: Publish monthly teardown articles or Loom walkthroughs of `Fin-Sync`, `Integration Dashboard`, and `Awozwa` to drive inbound traffic.
- **Lead nurture**: Build a welcome email sequence for new subscribers with value-packed touchpoints (audit checklist, conversion tips).
- **Partnership outreach**: Identify startup accelerators and SaaS communities for portfolio showcases or workshops.
- **Continuous case study updates**: Add new client wins or repackage existing work (`Rhenda Frontend`, `Cost Calculator`, `Abilive`) into niche landing page templates.

## Tooling & Resources

- Figma, FigJam, and Notion for planning and design system management.
- Next.js 14, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion, LottieFiles, `next-seo`, Resend/Formspree for development.
- Loom, Google Analytics 4, and Typeform for walkthroughs, analytics, and feedback capture.

## Risks & Mitigation

- **Limited quantified results**: If metrics are unavailable, craft narrative outcomes (strategy shifts, UX improvements) and gather qualitative feedback.
- **Asset inconsistency across older builds**: Recreate critical screens in Figma to ensure visual parity before exporting.
- **Scope creep from new service ideas**: Park emerging offers in a backlog document and schedule quarterly portfolio updates.
- **Tone misalignment between LiftOff and Abiodun’s personal brand**: Develop a brand voice guide covering tone, language, and posting style; review major assets through that lens before publishing.
